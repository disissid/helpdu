            BetterFlow provides its users with the ability to take notes in an easy and convenient manner, via the BetterFlow website and domain name offered from time to time (collectively, the “Website”) and/or the BetterFlow mobile application (the “Application” and together with the Website, the “BetterFlow Service”). The BetterFlow Service is owned and operated by Notekick Inc., a Delaware corporation (“BetterFlow”, “we” or “us”).

            <br><br>

            Your use of the BetterFlow Service is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”).

            <br><br>

            <strong>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE BetterFlow SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND TO ALL THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR TERMS OF SERVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO SUCH TERMS, EXIT THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE BetterFlow SERVICE.</strong>

            <br><br>

            We are committed to respect and protect the privacy of the personal information we obtain from you through the BetterFlow Service and we have created this Privacy Policy to inform you about how we collect, use and share your personal information, and about our privacy practices in general.

            <br><br>

            We are always ready to address your questions and concerns regarding this policy and our privacy practices. If you would like to contact customer service, please contact us via info@betterflow.co.

            <br><br>

            We continually strive to find new ways to enhance your experience with the BetterFlow Service and we may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our privacy practices. You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy periodically and to check the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Privacy Policy for the most recent version. If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of notice through the Website, the Application, or any other part of the BetterFlow Service.

            <br><br>

            <strong ><a class="anchor" name="terms"> </a>1. Terms of Service</strong>. Use of the BetterFlow Service is subject to the terms of our Terms of Service found at http://betterflow.co, which is hereby incorporated and made part of this Privacy Policy. By using the BetterFlow Service, you agree to be bound by our Terms of Service.

            <br><br>

            <strong><a class="anchor" name="types"></a>2. Types and Uses of Collected Information.</strong>BetterFlow collects two types of information about you:

            <br><br>

            <strong>a. </strong><u><strong>Personally Identifiable Information</strong></u>. Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific person. When you engage in certain activities via the BetterFlow Service, including but not limited to creating an account, sending feedback, or otherwise participating in the BetterFlow Service (collectively, “Identification Activities”), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your name, address (including zip code), email address and/or telephone number. When you enroll in the BetterFlow Service, we may also ask you to provide us with additional information, such as credit card information. Depending on the Identification Activity, some of the information we ask you to provide may be identified as mandatory and some identified as voluntary. If you do not provide mandatory information for a particular Identification Activity, you will not be permitted to engage in that Identification Activity with the BetterFlow Service. Depending on the Identification Activity, BetterFlow may not re-ask you for Personally Identifiable Information if such are already stored with us.

            <br><br>

            We may use Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and/or services to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the BetterFlow Service, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze use of the BetterFlow Service, improve the BetterFlow Service, and tailor your experience with third parties as provided below in this Privacy Policy. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.

            <br><br>

            <strong>b. </strong><u><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</strong></u>. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific person. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (“URL”) of the website you visited before coming to the BetterFlow Service or otherwise participating in the BetterFlow Service, the URL of the website you visit after leaving the BetterFlow Service, the type of browser you are using, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, mobile carrier information, mobile device information, or general and/or aggregated location data that does constitute Personally Identifiable Information. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers, may automatically collect this information when you visit or use the BetterFlow Service through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described below in this Privacy Policy. Most of the other information we collect for mobile, such as your mobile device identification and mobile device type, the request type, your mobile carrier, your mobile carrier user identification, and the content of your request, does not by itself identify you to BetterFlow, though it may be unique or consist of or contain information that you consider personal.

            <br><br>

            We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the BetterFlow Service, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers to measure the overall effectiveness of our products and services.

            <br><br>

            <strong><a class="anchor" name="release"></a>3. Release of Personally Identifiable Information. </strong>We will not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:

            <br><br>

            <strong>a. </strong><u><strong>Authorized Third Party Service Providers</strong></u>. BetterFlow may provide products and services through third parties. These “Third Party Service Providers” perform functions on our or your behalf. You or We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Third Party Service Providers to fulfill orders, move data in or out of the BetterFlow Service, analyze data, operate the BetterFlow Service, troubleshoot and provide customer service. We may also provide personal information to individuals and companies with whom we have business relationships and may share your information with Third Party Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.

            <br><br>

            <strong>b. </strong><u><strong>Remarketing</strong></u>. Remarketing is a way for us to connect with people, based upon your past interactions with the BetterFlow Service. Third-party marketing vendors may be hired by BetterFlow to perform remarketing services. As a result, third-party vendors, including Google, may show BetterFlow ads on sites on the Internet. Third-party vendors may use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to the BetterFlow Service. Users may opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.

            <br><br>

            <strong>c. </strong><u><strong>Acquisition</strong></u>. As with any other company, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.

            <br><br>

            <strong>d. </strong><u><strong>As required by law</strong></u>. We reserve the right to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us, enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, Terms of Service or other agreements or protect the rights, property or safety of the BetterFlow Service, users of the BetterFlow Service or others.
